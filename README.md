# Development Flow
- setup environment by installing creat-react-app
- had an issue with react not providing Templates
- uninstalled the global installation I had on my computer, but didn't solve it
- found a solution that worked by using [npx --ignore-existing create-react-app] 
- installed Flow.js for typing as the community said it was lightweigth and more flexible than Typescritp
- went through Flow.js documentation to understand how it worked with react
- however, as I've never coded with it before, decided to prioritize getting an MVP running instead
- an MVP, in my understanding, meant building a Music Player with audio funcionality, the ability to like the song plus a nice interactive UI
